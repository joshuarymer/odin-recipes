    <h1>How to make the best BLT</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The grilled cheese may give it a buttery run for its money, but the BLT has more grace.
    It doesn't come out of its corner firing on all cylinders, like a Cuban or a muffuletta,
    but a BLT has staminaâ€”each bite improves on the last. A Reuben may sucker-punch you with its
    one-two jab of salt and fat, but what the BLT lacks in pure power, it makes up for in subtlety
    and balance. The BLT is the true king of the sandwich ring, and it's my favorite sandwich of all 
    time.</p>
