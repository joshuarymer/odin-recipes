  <h1>Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe</h1>
  <img srcset="../img/tikka.jpg">
  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I probably get more requests for Indian food than any other ethnic cuisine, so I was very excited 
    to be posting this recipe for chicken tikka masala; until I found out it's actually a British 
    recipe. This is usually done with heavy cream, but I like to use coconut milk instead; the 
    subtle sweetness it provides works beautifully with the spices in the dish. Serve with steamed rice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons clarified butter (ghee), or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, finely grated</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated ginger, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 (13 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
        <li>½ cup chicken broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken in a bowl and drizzle olive oil over chicken; toss to coat.</li>
        <li>Whisk kosher salt, garam masala, ground cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika, 
        ground turmeric, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and cardamom together in a 
        small bowl. Season chicken with spice mixture and turn to coat evenly.</li>
        <li>Melt clarified butter in a large, heavy skillet over high heat. Cook chicken 
        thighs in hot butter until browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer 
        chicken to a plate. When cool enough to handle, cut chicken into bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat under the skillet to medium-high. Stir onion into skillet; saute 
        until onion softens and turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add tomato paste and 
        stir. Saute until paste caramelizes, about 5 minutes. Stir garlic and ginger 
        into tomato-onion mixture and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the crushed tomatoes into the skillet and bring to a boil while 
        scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet 
        with a wooden spoon. Pour in coconut milk and chicken broth; bring to 
        a simmer, reduce heat to medium low, and cook, stirring occasionally, 
        until flavors blend and sauce is slightly reduced, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir chicken, any accumulated juices from the chicken, coriander, and 
        red pepper flakes into tomato mixture; bring to a simmer, reduce heat 
        to medium-low, and cook until chicken is cooked through and tender, 
        10 to 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
