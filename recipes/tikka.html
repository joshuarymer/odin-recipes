  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I probably get more requests for Indian food than any other ethnic cuisine, so I was very excited 
    to be posting this recipe for chicken tikka masala; until I found out it's actually a British 
    recipe. This is usually done with heavy cream, but I like to use coconut milk instead; the 
    subtle sweetness it provides works beautifully with the spices in the dish. Serve with steamed rice.</p>
