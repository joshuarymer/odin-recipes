  <h1>Fast and Easy Pasta With Blistered Cherry Tomato Sauce Recipe</h1>

  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's a basic tomato rule of thumb when you're shopping at the supermarket: the smaller the tomato,
    the better, especially during the off-season. Larger tomatoes are picked while still green; if they were
    allowed to ripen on the vine (as all tomatoes would be in an ideal world), they'd bruise themselves under 
    their own weight during shipping. Cherry tomatoes, on the other hand, are picked when much closer to fully ripe. 
    Their small size means that even when ripe, they're tougher.Of course, it also helps that many cherry tomato varieties
    are bred to be both sweeter and higher in pectin than larger, beefsteak tomatoes. All of these factors—better flavor, 
    more sweetness, and high pectin content—mean that cherry tomatoes are fantastic for making a rich, thick, flavorful 
    sauce. Even better: It takes only four ingredients and about 10 minutes, start to finish—less time than it takes to 
    cook the pasta you're gonna serve it with.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound (450g) dry pasta</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>4 medium cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons (90ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds cherry tomatoes (about 2 pints; 675g)</li>
        <li>1 ounce fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped (about 1 cup; 30g)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place pasta in a large skillet or sauté pan and cover with water and a big pinch of salt. 
        Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally. Boil until just shy of al dente, 
        about 1 minute less than the package instructions recommend.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat garlic and 4 tablespoons (60ml) olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat, 
        stirring frequently, until garlic is softened but not browned, about 3 minutes. Add tomatoes and 
        cook, stirring, until tomatoes begin to burst, about 10 minutes. You can help them along by 
        pressing on them with the back of a wooden spoon as they soften.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook until sauce is rich and creamy, about 5 minutes longer. Stir in basil and season 
        to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>When pasta is cooked, drain, reserving 1 cup (240ml) pasta water. Add pasta to sauce and increase 
        heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring and tossing constantly and adding reserved pasta water as necessary 
        to adjust consistency to a nice, creamy flow. Remove from heat, stir in remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) 
        olive oil, and grate in a generous shower of Parmesan cheese. Serve immediately, passing extra Parmesan 
        at the table..</li>
