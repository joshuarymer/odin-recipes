  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's a basic tomato rule of thumb when you're shopping at the supermarket: The smaller the tomato,
    the better, especially during the off-season. Larger tomatoes are picked while still green; if they were
    allowed to ripen on the vine (as all tomatoes would be in an ideal world), they'd bruise themselves under 
    their own weight during shipping. Cherry tomatoes, on the other hand, are picked when much closer to fully ripe. 
    Their small size means that even when ripe, they're tougher.Of course, it also helps that many cherry tomato varieties
    are bred to be both sweeter and higher in pectin than larger, beefsteak tomatoes. All of these factors—better flavor, 
    more sweetness, and high pectin content—mean that cherry tomatoes are fantastic for making a rich, thick, flavorful 
    sauce. Even better: It takes only four ingredients and about 10 minutes, start to finish—less time than it takes to 
    cook the pasta you're gonna serve it with.</p>
