# odin-recipes

Create a website to showcase a selection of recipes. Website to include an index and three recipe pages. Each recipe page to include an image of the relevant meal, a list of ingredients and a list of steps, all organised under appropiately sized headers.

This project will allow me to demonstrate knowledge of html boilerplate, basic html tags, basic composition, and basic git practice.
